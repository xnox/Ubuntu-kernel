    The Kernel Team requires every bug to have certain logs attached before it can be worked on. The
    KernelBug class knows which logs are required. The rules for this method are:

    Bug status == "New":

       1. If the correct logs are attached the status is changed from "New" to "Confirmed".

       2. If it does not have the correct logs attached:
          a) It's status is changed from "New" to "Incomplete"
          b) A comment is added to the bug asking for the logs to be attached and how.
          c) The tag: "needs-logs" is added to the bug.

    Bug status == "Incomplete" & tagged with "needs-logs":

      1. If the correct logs are attached, the status is changed from "Incomplete" to
         "Confirmed".

      2. If it does not have the correct logs attached, no changes are made to it.

    Note: Only section 1, #1 has been implemented.
