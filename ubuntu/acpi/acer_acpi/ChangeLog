2007-09-01	Version 0.8

* Register backlight with backlight subsystem

* Register mail LED with LED subsystem

* Restored 3G support - please note that on WMID laptops, if you try to write
  to a device that you don't have, you _will_ get an ACPI error in dmesg (on
  AMW0 this just fails silently).

* Added new sysfs platform driver to /sys/devices/platform/acer_acpi

* Added EC support for Aspire 3020, 3040, 5040, 5650 and 9300

* Code clean up - switched C99 types to kernel types, removed typedefs

2007-08-02	Version 0.7

* Removed "enabled: X" support

* Added initial support for accessing extra devices/ information through the
  Embedded Controller (limited to just the Aspire 5020 and TravelMate 2490 -
  thanks to Petr Tomasek for the TravelMate 2490 support). To test this on
  another laptop, use "force_series=5020" or "force_series=2490" and report
  back the results. On the 5020 (AMW0), brightness and accurate reading of
  wireless and mail LED are supported. On the 2490 (WMID), mail LED is now
  supported, as well as reading touchpad status. Also, it is possible to force
  the fan on with both laptops by setting the temperature through ACPI.

* Added suspend/ resume support (settings will be correctly stored on return
  from suspend-to-RAM and suspend-to-disk).

* Removed typdefs
