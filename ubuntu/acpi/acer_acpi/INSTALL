Installation
************

1. You need the kernel sources (or kernel headers for your kernel)
installed to compile the driver.

2. Your kernel needs loadable module support with version information for
modules enabled. Usage of procfs is highly recommended.

2.4 series kernels are not supported - you must use a 2.6 series kernel.

In most cases you can skip the next step, the Makefile tries to determine
the correct directory on its own. Change KERNELSRC _only_ if the 
autodetection does not work for you. Otherwise proceed directly with step 4.

3. Before you compile the driver, change KERNELSRC in the makefile to your
path to the kernel build environment. If you are using a self compiled kernel,
point it to the root of your sources. If you are using a packaged kernel of
your distribution, install the package with kernel headers
(Debian:kernel-headers) and point KERNELSRC to where the headers and config
files are located. If you are using Debian, this
would be "/lib/modules/<kernelversion>/build".

4. Do:
	make

5. Do:
	make install
to install the kernel module. (You can use DESTDIR for repackaging).

If that step fails, try:

Copy the created files "wmi-acer.ko" and "acer_acpi.ko" to your kernel modules
path. For most distributions, this is usually:
"/lib/modules/<kernelversion>/kernel/drivers/char/".

Update module dependencies: depmod -a

6. Try loading the module with:
	insmod/modprobe wmi-acer (only do this step of loading acer_acpi doesn't
                                  load this module automatically).
	insmod/modprobe acer_acpi

On most Acer systems with 2.6.23 or newer kernels, acer_acpi should be
automatically loaded.

If you don't see any error messages, check the README for usage information.
