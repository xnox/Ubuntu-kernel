Release Date: 2007-08-08, ver 1.22 
RTL8187B Linux driver version 1.22 
 
   --This driver supports RealTek RTL8187/RTL8187B Wireless LAN NIC 
     for 
     2.6 kernel: 
     Fedora Core 2/3/4/5/6/7, Debian 3.1, Mandrake 10.2/Mandriva 2006,  
     SUSE 9.3/10.1/10.2, Gentoo 3.1, etc. 
     2.4 kernel: 
     Redhat 9.2, etc 
   - Support Client mode for either infrastructure or adhoc mode 
   - Support WEP, WPAPSK and WPA2PSK connection 
 
< Component > 
The driver is composed of several parts: 
	1. Module source code 
	  stack.tar.gz 
	  drv.tar.gz 
	 
	2. Script ot build the modules 
	  makedrv 
 
	3. Script to load/unload modules 
	  wlan0up  
	  wlan0down  
 
	4. Script and configuration for DHCP 
 	  wlan0dhcp 
	  ifcfg-wlan0 
	4. Supplicant source code: 
	  wpa_supplicant-0.5.3.tar.gz 
 
	5. Example of supplicant configuration file: 
	  wpa1.conf 
 
< Installation > 
Runing the scripts can finish all operations of building up modules  
from the source code and start the nic. 
	1. Build up the drivers from the source code 
	  ./makedrv 
 
	2. load the driver module to kernel and start up nic 
	  ./wlan0up 
          Note: when "insmod: error inserting 'xxxx.ko': -1 File exists" comes out 
                after run ./wlan0up, please run ./wlan0down first, then it should  
                be ok. 
 
< Set wireless lan MIBs > 
This driver uses Wireless Extension as an interface allowing you to set 
Wireless LAN specific parameters. 
 
Current driver supports "iwlist" to show the device status of nic 
        iwlist wlan0 [parameters] 
where 
        parameter explaination      	[parameters]     
        -----------------------     	-------------    
        Show available chan and freq	freq / channel   
        Show and Scan BSS and IBSS 	scan[ning]           
        Show supported bit-rate         rate / bit[rate]         
        Show Power Management mode      power              
 
For example: 
	iwlist wlan0 channel 
	iwlist wlan0 scan 
	iwlist wlan0 rate 
	iwlist wlan0 power 
 
Driver also supports "iwconfig", manipulate driver private ioctls, to set 
MIBs. 
 
	iwconfig wlan0 [parameters] [val] 
where 
	parameter explaination      [parameters]        [val] constraints 
        -----------------------     -------------        ------------------ 
        Connect to AP by address    ap              	[mac_addr] 
        Set the essid, join (I)BSS  essid             	[essid] 
        Set operation mode          mode                {Managed|Ad-hoc} 
        Set keys and security mode  key/enc[ryption]    {N|open|restricted|off} 
 
For example: 
	iwconfig wlan0 ap XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX 
	iwconfig wlan0 essid "ap_name" 
	iwconfig wlan0 mode Ad-hoc 
	iwconfig wlan0 mode essid "name" mode Ad-hoc 
	iwconfig wlan0 key 0123456789 [2] open 
	iwconfig wlan0 key off 
	iwconfig wlan0 key restricted [3] 0123456789 
 
< Getting IP address > 
After start up the nic, the network needs to obtain an IP address before 
transmit/receive data. 
This can be done by setting the static IP via "ifconfig wlan0 IP_ADDRESS" 
command, or using DHCP. 
 
If using DHCP, setting steps is as below: 
	(1)connect to an AP via "iwconfig" settings 
		iwconfig wlan0 essid [name]	or 
		iwconfig wlan0 ap XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX 
 
	(2)run the script which run the dhclient 
		./wlan0dhcp 
           or  
		dhcpcd wlan0 
              	(Some network admins require that you use the 
              	hostname and domainname provided by the DHCP server. 
              	In that case, use  
		dhcpcd -HD wlan0) 
		 
< WPAPSK/WPA2PSK > 
WPA_SUPPLICANT help the network to communicate under the protection of WPAPSK/WPA2PSK 
mechanism 
	 
	(1)Unpack source code of WPA supplicant: 
	  tar -zxvf wpa_supplicant-0.5.3.tar.gz 
	  cd wpa_supplicant-0.5.3 
	 
	(2)Create .config file: 
	  cp defconfig .config 
	 
	(3)Edit .config file, uncomment the following line: 
	  #CONFIG_DRIVER_IPW=y. 
		 
	(4)Build WPA supplicant: 
	  make 
	If make error for lack of <include/md5.h>, install the openssl lib(two ways): 
	 1. Install the openssl lib from corresponding installation disc: 
	    Fedora Core 2/3/4/5/6/7(openssl-0.9.71x-xx), 
            Mandrake10.2/Mandriva10.2(openssl-0.9.7x-xmdk), 
	    Debian 3.1(libssl-dev), Suse 9.3/10.0/10.1(openssl_devl), 
            Gentoo(dev-libs/openssl), etc. 
	 2. Download the openssl open source package from www.openssl.org, build and install it. 
	If make error for lack of <krb5.h>, first make sure krb5-devel & krb5-libs intalled.
	 If in Redhat, these files have been moved to "/usr/kerberos/include". So either make a symbol link 
	 or just add "CFLAGS += -I/usr/kerberos/include" to its makefile. 
	(5)Edit wpa_supplicant.conf to set up SSID and its passphrase. 
	  For example, the following setting in "wpa1.conf" means SSID  
          to join is "BufAG54_Ch6" and its passphrase is "87654321". 
	  network={ 
			ssid="BufAG54_Ch6" 
			proto=WPA 
			key_mgmt=WPA-PSK 
			pairwise=CCMP TKIP 
			group=CCMP TKIP WEP104 WEP40 
			psk="87654321" 
			priority=2 
		  } 
	Note: 1. proto=WPA for WPA, proto=RSN for WPA2.  
	      2. If you want to connect an AP which works under WPA2 mixed mode, you'd better 
                 use Realtek customed wpa_supplicant package. 
 
	(6)Execute WPA supplicant (Assume 8187B and related modules had been 
           loaded): 
	  ./wpa_supplicant -D ipw -c wpa1.conf -i wlan0 &
