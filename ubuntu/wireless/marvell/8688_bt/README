===============================================================================

1) FOR DRIVER BUILD

	Goto source code directory src_xxxx.
		make [clean] build
	The driver binaries can be found in ../bin_bt directory.

2) FOR DRIVER INSTALL

	a) Copy helper_sd.bin and sd8688.bin | sd8689.bin | ... to /lib/firmware/mrvl/ 
	   directory, create the directory if it doesn't exist.
	b) Install sdio bus driver and bluetooth driver,
		./load sd8688 | sd8689 | ...
	c) Uninstall bluetooth driver and sdio bus driver,
		./unload
3) cat /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config
   This command is used to get the current driver settings. 

4) cat /proc/net/mbt/hcix/status
   This command is used to get driver status

5) proc commands to config bluetooth parameters. 

drvdbg=[n]
   This command is used to set the bit masks of driver debug message control.

   	bit 0:  MSG  		PRINTM(MSG,...)
	bit 1:  FATAL		PRINTM(FATAL,...)
	bit 2:  ERROR		PRINTM(ERROR,...)
	bit 3:  CMD		PRINTM(CMD,...)
	bit 27: DATA		DBG_HEXDUMP(DBG_DATA,...)
	bit 28: ENTRY		PRINTM(ENTRY,...), ENTER(), LEAVE()
	bit 29: WARN 		PRINTM(WARN,...)
	bit 30: INFO 		PRINTM(INFO,...)

	Usage:
		echo "drvdbg=0x7" > /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config		#enable MSG,FATAL,ERROR messages

gpio_gap=[n]
   This command is used to configure the host sleep parameters.
	bit 8:0  -- Gap
	bit 16:8 -- GPIO

	where GPIO is the pin number of GPIO used to wakeup the host. It could be any valid
		GPIO pin# (e.g. 0-7) or 0xff (Interface, e.g. SDIO will be used instead).
		
	where Gap is the gap in milli seconds between wakeup signal and wakeup event 
		or 0xff for special setting.
	Usage:
		echo "gpio_gap=0xff80" > /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config   	# use Interface (e.g. SDIO)
		echo "hscfgcmd=1" > /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config		# gap = 0x80

		echo "gpio_gap=0x03ff" > /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config   	# use gpio 3
		echo "hscfgcmd=1" > /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config		# and special host sleep mode

psmode=[n]
    This command is used to enable/disable auto sleep mode
	
	where the option is:
			1 	-- Enable auto sleep mode
			0 	-- Disable auto sleep mode
	Usage:
		echo "psmode=1" > /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config		#enable power save mode
		echo "pscmd=1" > /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config

		echo "psmode=0" > /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config		#disable power save mode
		echo "pscmd=1" > /proc/net/mbt/hcix/config
