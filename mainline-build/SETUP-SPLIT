= Mainline Build Split Server Setup =

The mainline builds are designed to be split into at least two parts.
A central publishing server and a build server.  The build server is
responsible for the monitoring of remote sources and triggering builds
for those.  The results are then pushed centrally to the publishing server
which makes them available to consumers and announces them as required.

== Build Server ==

The build server is responsible for two aspects.  Firstly it monitors
the upstream trees for changes generating appropriate build requests.
Secondly it executes these build requests to generate complete builds
ready for publishing.

=== Setup and Configuration ===

The build server has a copy of the kteam-tools installed in the build
users home directory:

    {{{
git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/kteam-tools
}}}

Next we will need to pull down the existing build state (to prevent
retriggering of updates).  This is on the publishing server in
{{{incoming/state}}} and should be placed in public_html/state and
symlinked to COD/state:

    {{{
mkdir -p $HOME/public_html $HOME/COD
scp -r zinc.ubuntu.com:incoming/state/ $HOME/public_html/state
ln -s ../public_html/state $HOME/COD/state
}}}

We also require the publishing hook to be installed, this ensures that
the final builds are pushed to the publishing server when complete:

    {{{
ln -s ../kteam-tools/mainline-build/hook-publish $HOME/COD/hook-publish
}}}

We next need to install the appropriate private key (which will need to be
obtained from ~apw or a new one generated).  The key should be installed
as {{{$HOME/.ssh/mainline-publish}}}.

Finally we need to enable the regular triggers and builds by installing
the following cronjobs:

    {{{
0 04    *   *   *   USER=apw $HOME/kteam-tools/mainline-build/mainline-trigger-daily >>$HOME/logs/mainline-trigger-`date +\%Y-\%U` 2>&1
30 *    *   *   *   USER=apw $HOME/kteam-tools/mainline-build/mainline-trigger-hourly >>$HOME/logs/mainline-trigger-`date +\%Y-\%U` 2>&1
15  *    *   *   *   USER=<username> $HOME/kteam-tools/mainline-build/cod-execute >>$HOME/logs/cod-execute-`date +\%Y-\%U` 2>&1
}}}

== Publishing Server ==

At the center of the configuration is the publishing server,
kernel.ubuntu.com.  Here completed builds are pushed out to the web
server and announcements are sent.  For source packages they are signed
and uploaded to the appropriate PPAs.

Incoming publishin requests are pushed into the {{{$HOME/incoming}}}
directory and from there picked up by the publisher.

=== Setup and Configuration ===

The publishing server has a copy of the kteam-tools installed in the build
users home directory:

    {{{
git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/kteam-tools
}}}

Next we need to install the ssh configuration for the build server access
to incoming.  First we need to install the ssh validator command which needs
to be copied into {{{$HOME/bin}}}.

    {{{
mkdir -p $HOME/bin
cp $HOME/kteam-tools/mainline-builds/ssh-mainline-publish $HOME/bin
}}}

Then a record similar to the below needs to be added to the users
authorized_keys file:

    {{{
command="bin/ssh-mainline-publish" ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDGH6XysTtsaqviWguJ556ZLZ+/zrOYvL0NwOSXEe8wX6ogj2TUvTHbOHf01yfPkVQIG/w9j1rdUlcmRmKkaNBg00S4dnY2DAC0kSmS4R1TJcsDTnAGaNhOZQwLYOTOlbkhWs/r6K/HZmMBAoJxlgo55pkL0L/WJyGsXZTQpEvBc+cjlY28dGw9SeYTEc/+GGuL3W0E68zMfO+nD3YCAjuoJlPW/6wi2ePbE06Q5g9NrSP0OfbeHWHLHFf5qGvNNm5emQyObplQ/Ec4ncNIOhYPlrJkaqpLE24ZATLONUp1sw/sJjBEvpk7NJzRqU+7ime9KjkDy3nuYSTh2TA0ni4R testing-publish
}}}

Finally we need to enable publishing and cleanup by installing the following
cronjobs:

    {{{
0 08    *   *   *   USER=<username> $HOME/kteam-tools/mainline-build/cleanup >>$HOME/logs/cleanup-`date +\%Y-\%U` 2>&1
0,30  *    *   *   *   USER=<username> $HOME/kteam-tools/mainline-build/cod-incoming-publish >>$HOME/logs/cod-incoming-publish-`date +\%Y-\%U` 2>&1
}}}
