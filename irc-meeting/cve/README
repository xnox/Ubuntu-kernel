== (PART I) Daily - Simple case ==
       | bzr update
(cve1) | (or bzr branch the first time)
       | bzr pull http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/cve-tracker
       | bzr vis (in bzr-gtk package) sanity check

Quick triage
Are there any SHA1s to add to the break-fix line
from the matrix - after the next run after the above happens

(cve2) | bzr push lp:~canonical-kernel-team/ubuntu-cve-tracker/kernel-team/

The above is bundled into the cve1 and cve2 scripts

========= Weekly update (meeting) ============

Template is in kteam-tools/irc-meeting/cve/template
While in the bzr kernel-team directory, run the cve-count script, specify the number of days since last meeting
(defaults to 7 days)
copy the delta number into the template
The total number in the template comes from this page: http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/cve/pkg/ALL-linux.html

Update the reports page:

log into people
sudo su - kernel
edit this:
http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/status/cve-metrics.txt
and add the text from this:
 http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/cve/pkg/CVE-linux.txt
(which is autogenerated from the matrix)

Paste the template into IRC
