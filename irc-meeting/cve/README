== (PART I) Daily - Simple case ==
bzr update
(or bzr branch the first time)
bzr pull http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/cve-tracker
bzr vis (in bzr-gtk package) sanity check
bzr push lp:~canonical-kernel-team/ubuntu-cve-tracker/kernel-team/

Quick triage
Are there any SHA1s to add to the break-fix line
from the matrix - after the next run after the above happens

========= Weekly update (meeting) ============

Template is in kteam-tools/irc-meeting/cve/template
While in the bzr kernel-team directory, run the cve-count script, specify the number of days since last meeting
(defaults to 7 days)
copy the delta number into the template
The total number in the template comes from this page: http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/cve/pkg/ALL-linux.html

Update the reports page:

log into people
sudo su - kernel
edit this:
http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/status/cve-metrics.txt
and add the text from this:
 http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/cve/pkg/CVE-linux.txt
(which is autogenerated from the matrix)

Paste the template into IRC

================================================================

Daily update procedure:

upstream and kernel branches

third branch on people

bzr branch lp:~canonical-kernel-team/ubuntu-cve-tracker/kernel-team/

autotriager does 2 things - 

cve-sync
cve-rebase-transfer (has rebase mappings)

deleted the view pulls from the kernel team branch
attempts to pull, which is a fast forward from upstream
  If they've merged us, we can go to their tip
  if not, we go to their tip on a merge
full triage run
  pull tips of all our trees
  search for commit IDs in break/fix lines in active CVEs
  looks for that commit or any commit that has that CVE
  searches all tags and branch tip to find the release


-------------------------

ignore all this

apw> assuming you are starting from a _branch_ from the kernel team branch of the cve-tracker:
<apw> bzr branch lp:~canonical-kernel-team/ubuntu-cve-tracker/kernel-team/ 
<apw> then the autotriager output is pulled in as below:
<apw> apw@dm:~/bzr/cve-tracker/kernel-cve-tracker$ cat UPDATE
<apw> bzr pull http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/cve-tracker
